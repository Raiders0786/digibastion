Here you can:
- Browse lists organized by category
- Filter by your threat model
- Track your progress with interactive checkboxes

  items: [
    {
      id: "item-1",
      title: "Item Title",
      description: "Item description",
      completed: false,
      level: "essential", // or "recommended" or "optional"
      details: "Detailed explanation"
    }
    // Add more items...
  ]
};
```
